      <!-- What Is Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>What Is Black Seed Oil?</h3>
        <p>Black Seed Oil is cold-pressed from the seeds of <em>Nigella sativa</em>, a flowering plant native to
          southwestern Asia. Long celebrated in Middle Eastern, African, and Asian traditional medicine, it was favored
          by ancient civilizations—including Egyptians and Greeks—for digestive, respiratory, and skin ailments. Today,
          it’s prized as a nootropic adaptogen that supports cognitive performance alongside whole-body health.</p>
        <p>The star compound, <strong>thymoquinone (TQ)</strong>, exerts potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
          effects. In concert with thymohydroquinone, dithymoquinone, and other volatile oils, flavonoids, and essential
          fatty acids, Black Seed Oil forms a comprehensive neuroprotective and immune-enhancing profile.</p>
        <p>From boosting acetylcholine preservation to balancing neurotransmitters (GABA, serotonin, dopamine), its
          mechanisms align with modern nootropic principles—making it a cornerstone for those seeking natural,
          sustainable cognitive support.</p>

      <!-- Mechanisms Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>Mechanisms of Action</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Thymoquinone (TQ):</strong> Scavenges free radicals (ROS) and upregulates endogenous antioxidants
            (glutathione, SOD), while inhibiting inflammatory enzymes (COX, LOX), thereby reducing chronic oxidative
            stress and neuroinflammation.</li>
          <li><strong>Neurotransmitter Modulation:</strong> Enhances GABAergic signaling in the hippocampus for
            anxiolytic effects, while balancing serotonin and dopamine pathways to support mood, motivation, and reward
            processing.</li>
          <li><strong>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition:</strong> Inhibits acetylcholinesterase, preserving acetylcholine
            levels critical for memory encoding, attention, and processing speed—key nootropic actions.</li>
          <li><strong>Neuroprotection & Neurogenesis:</strong> Protects neurons from excitotoxic insults (amyloid-β,
            glutamate overload) and upregulates BDNF and other neurotrophic factors, promoting hippocampal neurogenesis
            and synaptic plasticity.</li>
          <li><strong>Immunomodulation:</strong> Boosts natural killer (NK) cell activity and macrophage phagocytosis,
            while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL‑1β, IL‑6, TNF‑α), ensuring balanced immune function without
            chronic inflammation.</li>
          <li><strong>Antimicrobial & Antiviral Activity:</strong> Demonstrates broad-spectrum effects against bacteria
            (Staph aureus, E. coli), fungi (Candida albicans), and certain viruses, helping maintain healthy gut flora
            and systemic defenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Hepatic Support & Detoxification:</strong> Lowers liver enzyme markers (ALT, AST) in clinical
            trials, enhances glutathione synthesis to facilitate detoxification pathways, and supports optimal metabolic
            function.</li>
          <li><strong>Hormonal & Metabolic Regulation:</strong> Shown to boost testosterone levels in men, improve
            insulin sensitivity, and favorably modulate lipid profiles (lower LDL, raise HDL), supporting cardiovascular
            health and energy metabolism.</li>

          <li><strong>Neuroprotection in Animal Models (2018):</strong> Rats pre-treated with Black Seed Oil (10 mg/kg)
            before exposure to neurotoxin (amyloid-β) exhibited 45% less neuronal death in the hippocampus and preserved
            spatial memory compared to controls.</li>
          <li><strong>Immune Function & Inflammation (2017):</strong> A clinical trial in 60 adults with seasonal
            allergies took 1,000 mg/day of Black Seed Oil for 6 weeks. Participants experienced a 50% reduction in
            allergy symptoms, significant decreases in IL‑6 and CRP levels, and a 20% increase in NK cell activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Male Fertility (2014):</strong> In infertile men (n=68), daily supplementation of 2,000 mg Black
            Seed Oil for 12 weeks resulted in a 70% increase in sperm count, 56% increase in motility, and a 48%
            improvement in semen volume compared to baseline measurements.</li>
          <li><strong>Liver Protection (2016):</strong> In a randomized trial of 80 adults with non-alcoholic fatty
            liver disease (NAFLD), 2,000 mg/day of Black Seed Oil for 12 weeks significantly reduced ALT and AST levels,
            improved hepatic steatosis on ultrasound, and increased glutathione by 35% compared to placebo.</li>
