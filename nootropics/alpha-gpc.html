      <!-- What Is Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>What Is Alpha-GPC?</h3>
        <p>Alpha-GPC (L-Alpha Glycerylphosphorylcholine) is a natural phospholipid choline source, found in soy and
          sunflower lecithin and synthesized in trace amounts by your body. Its unique glycerophosphate head allows it
          to cross the blood–brain barrier efficiently, making it one of the most potent choline supplements on the
          market.</p>
        <p>Unlike cheaper forms such as choline bitartrate or citrate, Alpha-GPC raises brain choline levels quickly,
          fueling acetylcholine-dependent processes like memory encoding, attention, and muscle contraction. It also
          supports neuronal membrane integrity, making it a dual-action nootropic and neuroprotectant.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Alpha-GPC has been shown to support cognitive resilience under stress and fatigue, making it a
          go-to ingredient in many nootropic stacks for sustained mental energy.</p>

      <!-- Mechanisms Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>Mechanisms of Action</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Acetylcholine Precursor:</strong> Supplies choline for acetylcholine synthesis, enhancing
            cholinergic signaling in hippocampus and cortex. This directly correlates with improved learning and memory
            formation.</li>
          <li><strong>Membrane Support:</strong> Donates glycerophosphate for phosphatidylcholine synthesis, repairing
            neuronal membranes and improving synaptic function.</li>
          <li><strong>Growth Hormone Release:</strong> Stimulates a pituitary surge in GH, supporting post-workout
            recovery and anabolic processes. Many athletes use Alpha-GPC pre-workout to boost both mental focus and
            physical performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Dopaminergic Modulation:</strong> Indirectly elevates dopamine turnover, improving mood,
            motivation, and reward-seeking behavior. This feature can be particularly helpful when overcoming brain fog
            or low-drive states.</li>
          <li><strong>Neurotrophic Effects:</strong> May upregulate BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), supporting
            long-term synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis—key for lasting cognitive health.</li>
          <li><strong>Neuroprotection:</strong> Shields neurons from oxidative stress and inflammation by promoting
            membrane repair and antioxidant pathways.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Core Benefits Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>Core Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Immediate Focus & Clarity:</strong> Feel a clean lift in mental energy within 30–60 minutes.
            Perfect for study sessions or demanding work tasks.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Memory:</strong> Supports both short-term encoding and long-term potentiation for recall.
            Ideal for students and professionals seeking an edge in information retention.</li>
          <li><strong>Mood & Motivation:</strong> Balances cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways to uplift mood, reduce
            stress, and improve drive. Many users report feeling more emotionally resilient.</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Performance:</strong> 600 mg pre-workout reliably increases peak force by ~14% in
            leg-press trials. Anecdotal reports suggest faster recovery between sets and improved mind-muscle
            connection.</li>
          <li><strong>Neuroprotection:</strong> Shields neurons against oxidative stress, supports membrane repair, and
            may lower risk of age-related cognitive decline.</li>
          <li><strong>Stress Resilience:</strong> Helps maintain cognitive function under stress, making it beneficial
            during high-pressure situations like exams or competitions.</li>

      <!-- Personal Experience Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>Personal Experience – How It Feels</h3>
        <p>Users consistently describe a “clean brain fog lift” rather than a jittery stimulant rush. Many compare the
          sensation to optimized machine-like focus without nervous energy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sharper Attention:</strong> Tasks feel more engaging, with fewer distractions. You’ll notice
            reading comprehension improves and you can power through lengthy reports or textbooks.</li>
          <li><strong>Better Endurance:</strong> Longer focus sessions feel less draining. Whether coding for hours or
            studying late into the night, you’ll maintain clarity without the midday slump.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Verbal Fluency:</strong> Words come more readily in conversation and writing, making it a
            great companion for presentations or creative writing sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Gym Gains:</strong> Noticeable increase in mind-muscle connection and post-set recovery. Athletes
            report heavier lifts and quicker bounce-back after intense workouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional Balance:</strong> Many users report feeling calmer under pressure, attributed to
            improved cholinergic-dopaminergic balance, which helps regulate stress hormones.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Side Effects & Safety Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>Side Effects & Safety</h3>
        <p>Alpha-GPC is generally well-tolerated. Side effects are rare and mild when dosing within recommended ranges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mild Headache or Brain Fog:</strong> Often results from choline overload; titrate down if headache
            occurs and retitrate when minimal dose discovered.</li>
          <li><strong>Nausea or Digestive Upset:</strong> At high doses (>1,200 mg/day), some experience mild GI
            discomfort. Taking with food often alleviates these symptoms.</li>
          <li><strong>Insomnia:</strong> Due to increased mental energy; avoid dosing within 4 hours of bedtime. Stick
            to morning or early afternoon doses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start at 300 mg and slowly increase until optimal cognitive or performance effect is
          reached. Monitor tolerance weekly.</p>
