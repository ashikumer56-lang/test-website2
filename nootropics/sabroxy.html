          <h2>Elevate Focus, Learning & Drive with Sabroxy®</h2>
          <p>Sabroxy® is a patented extract from the bark of the <em>Oroxylum indicum</em> tree, standardized to 20–25%
            Oroxylin-A. This potent phytochemical blend has been validated in clinical research to invigorate
            dopaminergic pathways, upregulate BDNF, and support robust cognitive function. Unlike traditional stimulants
            that can cause jitters and crashes, Sabroxy® offers a smooth, sustained enhancement in mental energy,
            motivation, and neural resilience.</p>
          <p>For centuries, Ayurvedic practitioners have used <em>Oroxylum indicum</em> to treat neurological and
            digestive ailments. Modern pharmacognosy has isolated Oroxylin-A as the key nootropic agent, demonstrating
            its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and modulate multiple neurotransmitter systems without the
            downsides of synthetic compounds. Today, Sabroxy® is celebrated among biohackers and cognitive athletes for
            its balanced profile—amplifying productivity while nurturing long-term brain health.</p>

      <!-- What Is Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>What is Sabroxy®?</h3>
        <p>Sabroxy® is a standardized proprietary extract of the <em>Oroxylum indicum</em> tree bark, which naturally
          contains a spectrum of flavonoids with Oroxylin-A as its flagship component. Oroxylin-A is recognized for its
          multifaceted neuropharmacological actions, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dopamine Reuptake Inhibition</strong>: Slows DAT transporter activity, increasing extracellular
            dopamine in prefrontal circuits to boost motivation and reward-driven behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>BDNF Upregulation</strong>: Activates CREB signaling cascades, elevating BDNF levels to support
            neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity—cornerstones of learning and memory.</li>
          <li><strong>GABA-A Modulation</strong>: Functions as a mild GABA-A antagonist to reduce inhibitory tone,
            promoting wakeful clarity without sedation.</li>
          <li><strong>Antioxidant & Anti-inflammatory</strong>: Neutralizes free radicals and downregulates microglial
            inflammatory cytokines, protecting neurons from chronic oxidative stress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because Sabroxy® is standardized for consistent Oroxylin-A levels, users can expect reliable, reproducible
          cognitive effects without batch variability common in raw herbal extracts.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- History & Traditional Use -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>History & Traditional Use</h3>
        <p>In traditional Ayurvedic medicine, ,<em>Oroxylum indicum</em>—commonly called the Indian trumpet flower—has
          been used as a neural restorative (Medhya Rasayana), digestive tonic, and immune modulator. Its bark, seeds,
          and root extracts appear in texts dating back over two millennia, prescribed for memory enhancement, anxiety
          relief, and gastrointestinal health.</p>
        <p>Ethnobotanical studies in Southeast Asia highlight the plant’s role in local healing rituals, where
          decoctions of bark and fruit are administered to elderly individuals to address cognitive decline. Modern
          research validates these ancient practices, isolating Oroxylin-A for its potent neuromodulatory properties.
