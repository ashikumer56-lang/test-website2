                    <h2>Tiger Milk Mushroom — a traditional tonic re-examined for modern health</h2>
                    <p>Tiger Milk Mushroom (<em>Lignosus rhinocerus</em>) is an uncommon medicinal fungus native to
                        Southeast Asia. Long used in indigenous systems for respiratory complaints, wound healing and
                        general vitality, recent phytochemical and clinical research highlight broad immunomodulatory,
                        anti‑inflammatory and neuroprotective activities concentrated in the sclerotium (the dense
                        underground tuber).</p>
                    <p>Unlike stimulants or acute symptom drugs, Tiger Milk supports resilience over weeks — improving
                        mucosal immunity, reducing airway inflammation, and supporting clearer cognition by lowering
                        systemic inflammatory load.</p>

            <!-- What Is -->
            <section class="section">
                <h3>What is Tiger Milk Mushroom?</h3>
                <p><strong>Lignosus rhinocerus</strong> is a polypore fungus whose medicinal value centers on its
                    sclerotium — a dense, nutrient‑packed structure that the fungus uses to survive seasonal stress. The
                    sclerotium contains polysaccharides (including immunologically active β‑glucans), triterpenoids,
                    phenolic antioxidants, and unique small molecules that likely explain its broad bioactivity.</p>
                <p>Historically reserved for serious ailments and respected as a rare remedy (it grows slowly and is
                    hard to cultivate), modern cultivation and standardized extracts now allow controlled dosing and
                    reproducible effects.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Traditional Use -->
            <section class="section">
                <h3>Traditional use & ethnobotany</h3>
                <p>Tiger Milk Mushroom appears in Southeast Asian folk medicine for bronchitis, chronic cough, fever,
                    and as a general restorative after illness. Traditional preparations included decoctions of the
                    sclerotium and topical poultices — methods that align with modern findings showing water‑soluble
                    polysaccharides are primary active fractions.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Mechanisms -->
            <section class="section">
                <h3>Mechanisms of action — what the molecules do</h3>
                <p>Multiple bioactive classes in the sclerotium converge on immune regulation, antioxidant protection
                    and tissue support:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Polysaccharides & β‑glucans:</strong> Bind to innate immune receptors (e.g., Dectin‑1),
                        increasing macrophage activity, modulating cytokine profiles and strengthening mucosal IgA
                        responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triterpenoids & phenolics:</strong> Reduce NF‑κB activation and downstream
                        proinflammatory cytokines (TNF‑α, IL‑6), which lowers chronic systemic inflammation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neuronal support:</strong> Antioxidant capacity and anti‑excitotoxic properties protect
                        neurons from oxidative stress and glutamate damage, supporting cognitive function indirectly by
                        preserving neural tissue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Airway & mucosal effects:</strong> Anti‑inflammatory and expectorant‑like activity
                        reduce bronchial hyperreactivity and mucus accumulation, improving airflow and symptom burden.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Benefits -->
            <section class="section">
                <h3>Core benefits — what people actually experience</h3>
                <p>Tiger Milk’s profile translates into benefits across systems — especially when taken consistently for
                    weeks.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Respiratory relief:</strong> Reduced coughing, less chest tightness and improved
                        breathing comfort in individuals with chronic respiratory complaints.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immune resilience:</strong> Fewer upper‑respiratory infections and faster recovery times
                        reported in trials and user cohorts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anti‑inflammatory support:</strong> Lower markers of systemic inflammation, which
                        supports mood, energy and cognitive clarity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neuroprotective & cognitive clarity:</strong> Subtle gains in focus and less brain fog
                        after 2–6 weeks — likely downstream from reduced inflammation and improved sleep in some users.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Gentle energy & vitality:</strong> Gradual increases in sustained energy rather than
                        stimulant spikes.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Clinical Research -->
            <section class="section">
                <h3>Clinical research summary</h3>
                <p>Clinical data — while still emerging — includes controlled human trials and numerous preclinical
                    studies that support traditional claims.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Respiratory function trials:</strong> Placebo‑controlled trials of standardized extracts
                        have shown improvements in lung function metrics and symptomatic relief in people with chronic
                        cough and bronchitis after 4–12 weeks of supplementation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immune markers:</strong> Supplementation increases secretory IgA in saliva and modulates
                        cytokine profiles toward a balanced immune response, reducing proinflammatory signaling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neuroprotection (preclinical):</strong> Extracts protect cultured neurons from
                        glutamate‑induced toxicity and reduce microglial activation in animal models.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Clinical note:</em> Effect sizes vary by extract standardization and dose — use COA‑verified
                    products standardized to the active polysaccharide fraction for reproducible outcomes.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mild gastrointestinal upset in a minority — usually resolves with food or dose reduction.</li>
                    <li>Allergic reactions are rare but possible — discontinue if rash, itching or respiratory distress
                        occur.</li>
                    <li>Potential immune modulation — consult your clinician if you are on immunosuppressants or have
                        autoimmune disease.</li>
                    <li>Pregnancy & breastfeeding: insufficient human data — avoid high‑dose supplementation unless

                <h3>Quality checklist & how to choose a product</h3>
                <p>Because Lignosus is still relatively niche, quality varies. Use this checklist when buying:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prefer standardized extracts that report polysaccharide content or a named clinical extract
                        (e.g., LiGNO™ TM02®).</li>
                    <li>Look for third‑party lab testing (COA) for heavy metals, microbial contamination and
                        polysaccharide assay.</li>
                    <li>Choose cultivated, not wild‑harvested, to ensure sustainability and consistent phytochemistry.
                    </li>
                    <li>Opt for reputable vendors with transparent sourcing and clear dosing guidance.</li>

                <h4>Final thoughts</h4>
                <p>Tiger Milk Mushroom offers a rare combination of respiratory, immune and neuroprotective support
                    rooted in traditional medicine and increasingly validated by modern research. It's not a quick fix,
                    but a resilience‑building tonic: effects accumulate over weeks and are best observed with
                    consistent, high‑quality extracts that disclose polysaccharide content. For anyone who struggles
                    with chronic cough, seasonal infections, or low‑grade inflammation that dents cognitive clarity,
                    Tiger Milk is a compelling, evidence‑aligned option.</p>
