          <h2>Enhance Memory, Reduce Anxiety & Promote Neurogenesis with Gotu Kola</h2>
          <p>Gotu Kola (Centella Asiatica), known as the “student herb” in Bali, has been used for millennia in Ayurveda
            and Traditional Chinese Medicine to sharpen the mind, improve memory, and reduce stress. Native to Southeast
            Asia’s wetlands, this adaptogenic herb supports cognitive clarity, neuroprotection, and balanced mood. Its
            active compounds—asiaticoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid—stimulate dendritic growth, protect neurons
            from oxidative stress, and regulate key neurotransmitters like GABA and acetylcholine.</p>
          <p>Whether you’re a student preparing for exams, a professional navigating high-pressure work, or anyone
            seeking to maintain brain health as you age, Gotu Kola offers a gentle yet powerful boost. Explore its
            mechanisms, dosage guidelines, clinical research, and real user feedback below to see why this “living brain
            tonic” deserves a place in your daily regimen.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h3>What is Gotu Kola?</h3>
        <p>Gotu Kola (Centella Asiatica) is an herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands in Southeast Asia. In
          Ayurveda, it’s known as “Brahmi” and is celebrated for enhancing memory, supporting mental clarity, and
          reducing anxiety. Traditional Chinese Medicine also values it for healing skin wounds and calming the spirit.
          The herb contains potent triterpenoids—asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid—along
          with flavonoids and essential vitamins that collectively promote neurogenesis, neuroprotection, and balanced
          neurotransmitter activity.</p>

        <h4>Neurogenesis in Animal Models</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Animal studies found that Gotu Kola extract increased dendritic growth by over 100% in hippocampal neurons
            and accelerated axon repair after induced neural injury.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Telomerase Activation (2019 Study)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A 2019 in vitro study showed Gotu Kola increased telomerase activity 8.8-fold in human fibroblasts,

      <section class="section">
        <h3>Side Effects & Warnings</h3>
        <p>Gotu Kola is generally well-tolerated, but potential adverse effects include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mild Skin Irritation:</strong> Topical use may cause itching or rash in sensitive individuals;
            discontinue if irritation occurs.</li>
          <li><strong>Headache & Nausea:</strong> Rare at higher doses; split dosage or reduce if symptoms appear.</li>
          <li><strong>Dizziness & Drowsiness:</strong> May occur in some users—avoid operating heavy machinery if
            affected.</li>
          <li><strong>Liver Toxicity:</strong> High doses over extended periods could stress liver function; monitor
            liver enzymes if using long-term.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Consult a healthcare provider before use if pregnant, breastfeeding, or on

      <!-- How It Feels Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>How It Feels</h3>
        <p>Gotu Kola’s effects are gradual and subtle. Commonly reported subjective experiences include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gentle Mental Clarity:</strong> A feeling of “mental lift” without jitteriness—ideal for long
            study sessions or demanding work.</li>
          <li><strong>Calm Alertness:</strong> Reduced anxiety and racing thoughts while maintaining focus and
            motivation.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Memory Recall:</strong> Better retention of facts, names, and details—especially
            noticeable in learning environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Improved Sleep Quality:</strong> Some users report deeper, more restful sleep and occasional lucid
            dreaming when taken in the evening.</li>
          <li><strong>Balanced Mood:</strong> A grounded, even‑keeled sense of well-being—helpful for stress management
            and emotional resilience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Peak benefits often emerge after 4–6 weeks of consistent use. Results depend on individual biochemistry,
          diet, and lifestyle factors. Combining Gotu Kola with other nootropics like Lion’s Mane or Bacopa Monnieri can
          produce synergistic cognitive effects.</p>
