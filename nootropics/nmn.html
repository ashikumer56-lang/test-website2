          <h2>Boost NAD+ Levels & Preserve Youthful Function with NMN</h2>
          <p>Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) is a direct precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a
            master coenzyme central to energy production, DNA repair, mitochondrial health and the activity of sirtuins
            — proteins tied to longevity. Supplementing NMN aims to restore age-declined NAD+ pools and support cellular
            resilience across tissues, including the brain.</p>

      <!-- What Is Section -->
      <section id="what-is" class="section">
        <h3>What is NMN?</h3>
        <p>Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) is a nucleotide derived from the B3 vitamin family. It sits in the salvage
          pathway that regenerates NAD+ from nicotinamide. NMN exists naturally in trace amounts in foods (broccoli,
          edamame, cabbage), but therapeutic doses are only practical via supplementation.</p>
        <p><strong>Quick facts</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>NMN is a bioavailable NAD+ precursor.</li>
          <li>It supports redox reactions, sirtuin activation and DNA repair.</li>
          <li>NAD+ levels decline with age and metabolic stress; NMN helps replenish them.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- How it works -->
      <section id="how-it-works" class="section deep-dive">
        <h3>How NMN Works — A Biochemical Deep Dive</h3>
        <p>Understanding NMN requires a quick tour of NAD+ metabolism. NAD+ functions both as an electron carrier
          (NADH/NAD+ redox pair) and as a substrate for enzymes like sirtuins and PARPs that consume NAD+ during
          reactions (e.g., ADP-ribosylation for DNA repair).</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Salvage pathway:</strong> NMN converts to NAD+ via NMN adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) enzymes located
            in the cytosol, nucleus and mitochondria. This replenishment is faster and more direct than converting
            nicotinamide or niacin through other routes.</li>
          <li><strong>Sirtuin activation:</strong> Sirtuins (SIRT1–7) are NAD+-dependent deacetylases that regulate
            mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolic gene expression and stress resistance. Higher NAD+ from NMN increases
            sirtuin activity, which is associated with improved metabolic and cognitive function.</li>
          <li><strong>DNA repair & PARPs:</strong> PARP enzymes use NAD+ to signal and execute DNA repair. Adequate NAD+
            supports genomic stability and reduces accumulation of DNA damage over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Mitochondrial effects:</strong> NAD+ promotes mitochondrial function through PGC-1α and enhances
            oxidative phosphorylation capacity, which translates to improved cellular energy.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Pharmacokinetics note:</strong> Emerging research suggests NMN is taken up by tissues via specific
          transporters (e.g., Slc12a8 in mice — transporter identity in humans is still being studied). Some forms
          (sublingual, stabilized powders) claim improved bioavailability.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Benefits Section -->
      <section id="benefits" class="section">
        <h3>Evidence-backed Benefits (Human & Animal)</h3>
        <p>NMN's range of observed benefits spans metabolic health, physical performance, brain function, and markers of
          cellular aging. Individual response varies with baseline health, age, and genetics.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Metabolic health:</strong> Improved insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles in some human and
            animal studies.</li>
          <li><strong>Physical performance:</strong> Enhanced endurance, greater skeletal muscle mitochondrial function
            and quicker recovery in animal models and early human trials.</li>
          <li><strong>Cognitive support:</strong> Improved memory, attention and neuroprotection in animal models of
            neurodegeneration; promising early signals in humans.</li>
          <li><strong>Vascular function:</strong> Improved endothelial function and blood flow, supporting
            cardiovascular resilience.</li>
          <li><strong>Cellular resilience:</strong> Reduced markers of DNA damage and improved mitochondrial markers in
            tissues examined.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Longevity Research -->
      <section id="longevity" class="section highlight">
        <h3>NMN & Longevity — What the Research Suggests</h3>
        <p>In animal models, NMN supplementation has reversed multiple age-related declines: improved muscle function,
          better glucose tolerance, enhanced mitochondrial efficiency, and even markers consistent with extended
          healthspan. Translating lifespan extension from mice to humans is complex, but NMN's action on conserved
          pathways (NAD+, sirtuins, PARPs) positions it as a strong longevity candidate.</p>

        <p><strong>Practical takeaway:</strong> Expect NMN to support healthspan (quality of life, metabolic health,
          resilience) more reliably than it will necessarily extend lifespan — although better healthspan can contribute
          to longer life indirectly.</p>

      <!-- Human Studies -->
      <section id="human-studies" class="section">
        <h3>Human Clinical Trials — Summary</h3>
        <p>Clinical research on NMN is growing. Key themes from human trials include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Short-term NMN (weeks to months) safely raises NAD+ metabolites in blood.</li>
          <li>Improvements in insulin sensitivity and flow-mediated dilation have been recorded in small cohorts.</li>
          <li>Early cognitive endpoints show promise but require larger, longer trials for confirmation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Note on evidence quality:</strong> Many human trials are small, often lack long-term follow-up, and
          sometimes use different formulations/doses — interpret with healthy skepticism and look for replication.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Protocols Section -->
      <section id="protocols" class="section">
        <h3>Practical Protocols, Dosing & Timing</h3>
        <p>Below are practical, commonly used protocols informed by clinical studies and practitioner experience. These
          are educational examples; consult a clinician for personal medical advice.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Starter protocol:</strong> 125–250 mg/day for 2–4 weeks to test tolerance and observe changes in
            energy and sleep.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance protocol:</strong> 300–500 mg/day split AM/early afternoon for athletes and those
            seeking endurance benefits.</li>
          <li><strong>Longevity protocol:</strong> 250–300 mg/day long-term; some practitioners cycle 8–12 weeks on, 2–4
            weeks off or vary dose seasonally.</li>
          <li><strong>Sublingual approach:</strong> 50–150 mg sublingual formulations are used by some for potentially
            improved uptake; hold under tongue for 60–90 seconds before swallowing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>When to take:</strong> Morning or early afternoon to align with circadian NAD+ rhythms and avoid rare
          sleep disruption. Take on an empty stomach for best absorption unless GI upset occurs.</p>

        <p><strong>How long to wait for effects:</strong> Metabolic and energy effects can be noticeable in days–weeks;
          changes in biomarkers and structural improvements often require months.</p>

      <!-- FAQ Section -->
      <section id="faq" class="section">
        <h3>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h3>
        <h4>Is NMN better than NR (Nicotinamide Riboside)?</h4>
        <p>Both are NAD+ precursors. NMN is closer to NAD+ in the salvage pathway and may raise NAD+ more directly in
          some tissues. NR is more studied historically in humans. Choice depends on formulation, cost, and personal
          response.</p>

        <h4>Will NMN make me live longer?</h4>
        <p>Animal studies show improvements in healthspan markers; whether NMN prolongs human lifespan is unknown.
          Expect better metabolic and functional aging rather than guaranteed lifespan extension.</p>

        <h4>Can young healthy adults benefit?</h4>
        <p>Yes, benefits like improved energy, exercise recovery and mitochondrial support may be felt, though the
          biggest relative gains are often in older or metabolically challenged individuals.</p>
