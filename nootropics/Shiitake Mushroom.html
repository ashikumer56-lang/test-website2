            <!-- TLDR -->
            <section class="section">
                <h3>Quick summary (TL;DR)</h3>
                <p>Shiitake delivers immune‑modulating β‑glucans, the polysaccharide lentinan, antioxidant
                    ergothioneine, and lipid‑modulating eritadenine. Together these compounds reduce neuroinflammation,
                    protect mitochondria, support hepatic and cardiovascular health, and promote sustained cognitive
                    performance and resilience. Typical supplemental extract doses run 500–1,000 mg/day (standardized
                    hot‑water extracts for β‑glucans). Culinary use (5–10 g cooked daily) provides nutritive benefits
                    and regular intake of ergothioneine.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h3>What is Shiitake?</h3>
                <p>Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) is a saprophytic fungus native to East Asia and one of the most widely
                    cultivated edible mushrooms globally. In TCM, it’s long been used to boost vitality and resistance
                    to disease. Modern phytochemistry identifies several families of active constituents:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>β‑Glucans / Lentinan:</strong> Immunomodulatory polysaccharides that enhance innate and
                        adaptive responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ergothioneine:</strong> A potent dietary antioxidant concentrated in the brain and
                        mitochondria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eritadenine:</strong> Alkaloid with lipid‑lowering and circulation support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phenolics & sterols:</strong> Add antioxidant and anti‑inflammatory activity.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Mechanisms -->
            <section class="section">
                <h3>Core nootropic mechanisms — how Shiitake supports the brain</h3>
                <p>Shiitake’s benefits for cognition are indirect but powerful — by improving immune balance, lowering
                    chronic inflammation, protecting mitochondria, and enhancing vascular function, it creates an
                    environment where cognition can thrive.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h3>Pharmacology, absorption & bioavailability</h3>
                <p>Bioavailability and activity depend on extraction method. Key practical points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hot‑water extracts:</strong> Best for extracting β‑glucans and lentinan — favored for
                        immunomodulatory and therapeutic uses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alcohol extracts:</strong> Enrich sterols and lipophilic compounds but are less
                        efficient for β‑glucans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ergothioneine uptake:</strong> Absorbed and taken up via the OCTN1 transporter, it
                        preferentially accumulates in brain and mitochondria — a unique dietary antioxidant reservoir.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Processing matters:</strong> Cooking increases bioavailability versus raw mushrooms, hot
                        water extraction provides concentrated polysaccharides similar to clinical preparations.</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Documented Benefits -->
            <section class="section">
                <h3>Evidence‑based benefits</h3>
                <p>This section summarizes the most relevant outcomes from preclinical and human studies and how they
                    translate to practical effects.</p>

                <h4>Immune resilience & antiviral support</h4>
                <p>Lentinan and related β‑glucans enhance NK cell activity, macrophage function, and balanced cytokine
                    production. Clinical uses in Japan and China include adjunctive support in oncology and immune
                    recovery protocols.</p>

                <h4>Neuroprotection & mitochondrial support</h4>
                <p>Ergothioneine protects neurons against oxidative insults and mitochondrial dysfunction — processes
                    implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. Regular dietary intake correlates with biomarkers of
                    reduced oxidative stress.</p>

                <h4>Cognitive endurance & mood</h4>
                <p>By reducing low‑grade inflammation and improving sleep and energy via immune‑metabolic improvements,
                    Shiitake can ameliorate brain fog, increase sustained attention, and enhance mood stability over
                    weeks of use.</p>

                <h4>Cardiometabolic health</h4>
                <p>Eritadenine contributes to improved lipid profiles in animal models and small human studies,
                    supporting vascular health essential for cognition.</p>

                <h3>Selected clinical & translational research (practical takeaways)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Immunomodulation:</strong> Human trials demonstrate enhanced NK cell activity and
                        improved infection outcomes in populations supplemented with β‑glucan extracts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adjunctive oncology:</strong> Lentinan used as adjunct therapy improved survival metrics
                        in certain Japanese trials when combined with conventional care (contextual and supervised
                        clinical use).</li>
                    <li><strong>Metabolic endpoints:</strong> Small RCTs and pilot studies show eritadenine‑containing
                        extracts can modestly improve lipid panels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Practical note:</em> Most clinical immunology and oncology data involve specific, standardized
                    extracts and controlled settings — replicate those effects only with verified extracts and clinical
                    supervision when needed.</p>

                <p>Shiitake mushroom bridges culinary pleasure and potent medicinal value. Its unique combination of
                    immunomodulatory polysaccharides, mitochondrial antioxidants, and lipid‑modulating alkaloids makes
                    it an excellent addition to any regimen focused on long‑term brain health, immune resilience, and
                    sustained cognitive performance. Use hot‑water extracts for consistent therapeutic effects, include
                    culinary shiitake for daily nourishment, and prioritize quality suppliers with transparent testing.
                    When used alongside deliberate cognitive practice and healthy lifestyle habits, Shiitake can be a
                    durable ally in your pursuit of vitality and mental clarity.</p>
