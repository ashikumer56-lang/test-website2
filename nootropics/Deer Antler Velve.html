        <h3>What is Deer Antler Velvet?</h3>
        <p>Deer Antler Velvet refers to the soft, vascularized tissue that covers deer antlers during their rapid growth
          phase. Harvested before the antlers harden, this velvet is a nutrient-dense source of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1):</strong> Promotes cell growth, muscle hypertrophy, and
            recovery.</li>
          <li><strong>IGF-2:</strong> Supports tissue regeneration and metabolic functions.</li>
          <li><strong>Collagen & Glucosamine:</strong> Essential for healthy joints, cartilage, and connective tissue.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Essential Amino Acids:</strong> Building blocks for protein synthesis and muscle repair.</li>
          <li><strong>Minerals (Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium):</strong> Critical for bone density, nerve transmission,
            and enzymatic reactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Traditionally used by Chinese healers to enhance vitality, improve physical performance, and support hormonal
          balance, Deer Antler Velvet remains a popular adaptogen and regenerative supplement among modern athletes,
          biohackers, and health enthusiasts seeking natural, whole‚Äëfood‚Äìbased enhancement.</p>

          performance needs. Its blend of IGF-1, amino acids, and adaptogenic peptides supports accelerated muscle
          recovery, enhanced joint health, balanced hormones, and a calm yet driven mental state. However, it‚Äôs not

            effects unfolding over months.</li>
