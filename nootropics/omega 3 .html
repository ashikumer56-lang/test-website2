          <h2>Unlock Resilience, Clarity & Emotional Stability with Omega-3</h2>
          <p>EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that act as
            foundational building blocks for the brain. They influence membrane fluidity, neurotransmission,
            inflammation resolution and gene expression. Modern diets are often deficient in EPA/DHA, and that deficit
            shows up as mood instability, cognitive fog, and increased vulnerability to neuroinflammatory disease.</p>

      <!-- What is -->
      <section id="what-is" class="section">
        <h3>What is Omega-3 (EPA & DHA)?</h3>
        <p>Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fats essential for human health. The most relevant types for brain
          health are EPA and DHA. EPA is mainly anti-inflammatory and supports mood; DHA integrates into neuronal
          membranes and supports structural and signaling roles in the brain.</p>
        <p>Because humans inefficiently convert the plant-derived ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) into EPA/DHA, direct
          dietary or supplemental intake of EPA and DHA is recommended for reliable brain effects.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Why it matters -->
      <section id="why-it-matters" class="section">
        <h3>Why Omega-3 Matters for the Brain</h3>
        <p>The brain is nearly 60% fat by dry weight, and DHA is one of the most abundant fatty acids in neuronal
          membranes. Membrane composition affects receptor conformation, ion-channel behaviour, neurotransmitter
          reuptake, and the speed of synaptic signaling. Omega-3 deficiency changes membrane properties and promotes a
          pro-inflammatory state — both of which negatively affect cognition, mood, and resilience to stress.</p>

        <p>Restoring EPA/DHA can improve synaptic plasticity, support myelination, and enhance the expression of
          neurotrophins such as BDNF — molecular changes that underpin learning, memory and emotional regulation.</p>

      <!-- Benefits expanded -->
      <section id="benefits" class="section">
        <h3>Core Benefits (Expanded)</h3>
        <p>Below we expand on benefits with practical examples and realistic expectations.</p>
        <h4>Mood & Depression</h4>
        <p>EPA-predominant formulas (≥60% EPA in the EPA+DHA blend) show the most consistent antidepressant
          advantages, especially in patients with elevated inflammatory markers. Clinical benefit is often gradual,
          appearing over 4–12 weeks.</p>

        <h4>Attention & ADHD</h4>
        <p>In children and adults with attention problems, omega-3 supplementation improves attention, reduces
          hyperactivity and enhances learning outcomes. Effects are modest but clinically meaningful and additive to
          behavioral strategies.</p>

        <h4>Cognitive Aging</h4>
        <p>Long-term DHA intake correlates with preserved gray matter volume, improved memory retention, and slower
          progression of age-related cognitive decline. While not a cure for dementia, adequate EPA/DHA intake is a
          modifiable protective factor.</p>

        <h4>Inflammation-Related Conditions</h4>
        <p>Omega-3s reduce systemic inflammation markers (CRP, IL-6), which translates to benefits in mood disorders,
          metabolic syndrome, and some autoimmune conditions where neuroinflammation contributes to cognitive symptoms.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Evidence -->
      <section id="evidence" class="section">
        <h3>Clinical Evidence & Meta-Analyses — Highlights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Meta-analyses of omega-3 trials for depression find small-to-moderate effect sizes; benefits concentrated
            in
            EPA-predominant trials.</li>
          <li>Systematic reviews in ADHD report small but significant improvements in attention and hyperactivity scores
            with multi-month supplementation.</li>
          <li>Longitudinal cohort studies link higher DHA levels to reduced risk of dementia and better memory
            performance in aging adults.</li>
          <li>Cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory benefits are well established and may indirectly protect brain
            health.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Evidence quality varies — seek replication and larger trials for definitive claims. If you want, I can
            add
            numbered citations to key papers (RCTs, meta-analyses) in the next revision.</em></p>
      </section>

      <!-- Protocols and stacking -->
      <section id="protocols" class="section">
        <h3>Protocols, Dosing & Stacking</h3>
        <p>Dosing should match the goal: mood, cognition, anti-inflammatory, or general health.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mood focus:</strong> 1,000–2,000 mg combined EPA+DHA daily with EPA-predominant formulation (aim
            for
            ≥1,000 mg EPA/day when possible).</li>
          <li><strong>Cognition / aging support:</strong> 1,000–2,000 mg/day with emphasis on DHA for structural brain
            benefits (600–1,000 mg DHA/day).</li>
          <li><strong>ADHD support (children):</strong> 500–1,000 mg/day (adjust by body weight and pediatric guidance).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Anti-inflammatory / recovery:</strong> 2,000–3,000 mg/day under clinical supervision for
            short-term
            cycles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Stacking ideas</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>With phosphatidylserine:</strong> improves membrane support and cognitive signaling in
            combination.</li>
          <li><strong>With uridine & choline:</strong> synergistic effect on membrane phospholipid synthesis and
            synaptogenesis.</li>
          <li><strong>With vitamin D & magnesium:</strong> often deficient in the same populations; these support mood
            and
            immune function alongside omega-3s.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Choosing High-Quality Omega-3 Supplements</h3>
        <p>Follow these rules-of-thumb when buying supplements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose products with third-party testing (IFOS, USP, Labdoor) to confirm purity and oxidation levels.</li>
          <li>Prefer triglyceride-form fish oil over ethyl ester for absorption if possible.</li>
          <li>Look for enteric-coated or flavored formulas to reduce fishy burps.</li>
          <li>Check EPA:DHA ratio depending on your goal (EPA-heavy for mood, DHA-heavy for structural brain support).
          </li>
          <li>For vegan options, pick algae-derived DHA with clear EPA content if provided or stack with EPA capsules.

        <h3>Safety, Interactions & Special Populations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Omega-3s are generally safe; common effects are mild GI symptoms and fishy aftertaste.</li>
          <li>They have an anticoagulant effect at high doses — consult your doctor if you take blood thinners or have a
            bleeding disorder.</li>
          <li>High-quality supplements minimize heavy metals and PCBs; choose tested brands.</li>
          <li>Pregnancy & breastfeeding: DHA is recommended for fetal brain development; follow obstetric guidance on
            dosing.</li>
          <li>Children: use pediatric formulations and consult a pediatrician for ADHD or developmental use.</li>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section id="faq" class="section">
        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <h4>Q: How long until I feel benefits?</h4>
        <p>A: Mood and attention improvements often take 4–12 weeks. Structural brain benefits require months to years
          of
          consistent intake.</p>

        <h4>Q: Should I take fish oil or algae oil?</h4>
        <p>A: Fish oil provides both EPA & DHA naturally. Algae oil is a great vegan source of DHA; combine with EPA if
          you need the EPA-specific mood benefits (via an additional supplement if necessary).</p>

        <h4>Q: Can omega-3s replace prescription antidepressants?</h4>
        <p>A: No — omega-3s are adjunctive. They can improve outcomes when combined with psychotherapy and medication
          under clinical supervision, especially in inflammation-related depression.</p>
