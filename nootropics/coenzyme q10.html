          <h2>Enhance Cellular Energy & Protect Cells with CoQ10</h2>
          <p>CoEnzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a fat-soluble, vitamin-like compound naturally present in virtually every cell. Central to mitochondrial ATP production, it also serves as a powerful antioxidant‚Äîshielding cells, including neurons and cardiac muscle, from oxidative damage. As endogenous levels decline with age, stress, or statin use, supplementation can restore vitality and support cognitive and cardiovascular health over time.</p>
          <p>Whether you‚Äôre recovering from fatigue, seeking a sustainable energy boost, or aiming to safeguard your heart and brain, CoQ10 acts as a foundational nootropic. Embrace this ‚Äúmitochondrial catalyst‚Äù for steady improvements in mental clarity, stamina, and overall resilience‚Äîwithout jitters or crashes.</p>

        <h3>What is CoEnzyme Q10?</h3>
        <p>CoEnzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a fat-soluble, vitamin-like quinone found in nearly every cell of the human body. It functions primarily in the mitochondrial electron transport chain‚Äîfacilitating ATP synthesis, the cell‚Äôs main energy currency. Beyond its bioenergetic role, CoQ10 acts as a potent antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals and reducing oxidative stress.</p>
        <p>Although our bodies synthesize CoQ10 endogenously, levels decline significantly with aging, chronic stress, and certain medications (especially statins). Dietary sources include oily fish (salmon, mackerel), organ meats (liver, heart), and some nuts. However, supplementation is often necessary to maintain optimal levels for energy production, neuroprotection, and cardiovascular support.</p>

      <!-- History & Traditional Use Section -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>History & Traditional Use</h3>
        <p>CoQ10 was first identified in 1957 by Dr. Frederick Crane and colleagues. Although it does not have a long history in traditional herbal medicine, its discovery revolutionized our understanding of cellular energy. Since then, CoQ10 has been studied extensively for its role in mitochondrial disorders, cardiovascular health, and age-related decline.</p>
        <p>In traditional dietary practices, foods rich in CoQ10‚Äîsuch as organ meats and oily fish‚Äîwere valued for their vitality-boosting properties. Modern supplement formulations deliver concentrated doses to address deficiencies and support overall metabolic function.</p>
